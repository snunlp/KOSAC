# KOSAC
KOrean Sentiment Analysis Corpus

## About
The KOrean Sentiment Analysis Corpus, KOSAC, is built for capturing sentiment expressions and their patterns in Korean and representing their meaning to be interpretable for a computer. To represent the meaning, a fine-grained annotation scheme called KSML (Shin et al., 2012) is developed identifying key components and properties of sentiments based on solid theoretical background. The annotation scheme has been employed in the manual annotation of a 7,713-sentence corpus of 332 news articles from the Sejong syntactic parsed corpus.
